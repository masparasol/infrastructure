# MAINTAINERS

The Rack Guild ("The Rack," "Rack") supports Noisebridge by repairing, hardening, and adding to critical infrastructure projects.  

Infrastructure covers the following:

- Physical Equipment
    - Borrowed/Leased from provider(s)
    - Routers, switches, APs, UPS, and any other physical device in the Hackerspace
    - Access control hardware including RFID readers, RaspPi driver
- Hackerspace networking
- Managing the primary domain
- Deployment through ansible
- Backing up critical services and configuration
    - Access Control
    - Router
    - Ansible
    - etc. 

We hold the sanctity of The Network above all else.  Rogue equipment will be sacrificed to the diety of uptime.

Maintainers actively work on noisebridge infrastructure.  If you wish to join the team, simply create a PR and add your github account to the bottom.  We'll see it and say hi.
